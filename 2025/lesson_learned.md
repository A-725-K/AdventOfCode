# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 2
Given the limited amount of days, this year the difficulty slope will be steep.
While the first part was quite straightforward, adapting the algorithm for the
second part took me a bit of time. Eventually I kept it simple, after yesterday,
I've learned that sometimes simplicity pays off. While it took ~1s to solve the
problem on the real input, it is still a fairly fast algorithm, given that I was
running the debug version (`cargo run` instead of `cargo run --release`). There
was an edge case I had to treat it separately which I believe could be integrated
in the actual solving algorithm, but I am happy with how the code looked like
eventually. Satisfied!

# Day 1
Another year, another Aoc! Sad to see that this year it will be shorter,
but the author has my full support given his reasons! And in this AI world,
it is still good to experience such good quality in this game, I am very thankful!
From the beginning, part 2 hit me hard: I always forget to keep it as simple
as possible, and reason about the constraints, it would have saved me some time.
Nevertheless the start is smooth, looking forward to tomorrow's problem already!
Let's begin!
