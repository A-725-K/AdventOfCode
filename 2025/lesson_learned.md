# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 5
Also today's problem was a walk in the park. It was clear from the beginning that
there would have been some range-merging algorithm involved, but for the first
part I decided to go with the simplest and inefficient solution that took ~1ms
to run anyway. Nothing compared to day 9 of 2024 :) Simple!

# Day 4
Today was a relaxing problem. Simple matrix structure and easy requirements, the
easiest so far for me. Not much to add. Happy :)

# Day 3
After 4 years of AoC I start to see some fruits of my work :) The first problem
has been fairly trivial for me. For the second part, instead I was surprised how
fast I could come up with an optimal solution. I tried to implement 3 different
strategies, but the first 2 were not correct. Nonetheless, they helped me to
understand what I was doing wrong. All in all was a successful day. Enjoyable!

# Day 2
Given the limited amount of days, this year the difficulty slope will be steep.
While the first part was quite straightforward, adapting the algorithm for the
second part took me a bit of time. Eventually I kept it simple, after yesterday,
I've learned that sometimes simplicity pays off. While it took ~1s to solve the
problem on the real input, it is still a fairly fast algorithm, given that I was
running the debug version (`cargo run` instead of `cargo run --release`). There
was an edge case I had to treat it separately which I believe could be integrated
in the actual solving algorithm, but I am happy with how the code looked like
eventually. Satisfied!

# Day 1
Another year, another Aoc! Sad to see that this year it will be shorter,
but the author has my full support given his reasons! And in this AI world,
it is still good to experience such good quality in this game, I am very thankful!
From the beginning, part 2 hit me hard: I always forget to keep it as simple
as possible, and reason about the constraints, it would have saved me some time.
Nevertheless the start is smooth, looking forward to tomorrow's problem already!
Let's begin!
