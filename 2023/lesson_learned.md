# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 1
A bit of stretching and... let's start! AoC once again, the most wonderful time
of the year is colored with ton of fun given by the joy of solving the riddles!
Can't wait for tommorow :)
