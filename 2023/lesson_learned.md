# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 2
Parsing gymnastics. Very fun and still very easy, once you figure out how to
organize properly the input. READ CAREFULLY THE EXAMPLE! That said, let's go
to the next!

# Day 1
A bit of stretching and... let's start! AoC once again, the most wonderful time
of the year is colored with ton of fun given by the joy of solving the riddles!
Can't wait for tommorow :)
