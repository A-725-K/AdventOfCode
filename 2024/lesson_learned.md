# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 4
Today I propose a nice and clean solution! I was a little bit worried in the
beginning because I know Rust is known to complicate iterating on a string
due to its extensive UTF-8 support, but eventually turned out to be not too
difficult to manipulate a `Vec<Vec<char>>`. I enjoyed refining my solution and
exploring some Rust features (e.g. `std::slice::Iter` crate) to make it nicer!
Moreover, crosswords are one of my favorites hobby, so today I also appreciated
the lore :) Git-push!

# Day 3
Very easy and fun problem to solve! Rust FTW once again, even though the fact
that regex are not part of the core language was a little weird :) Let's go!

# Day 2
First star easy-peasy... and then the challenge hit me! It took way longer than
expected to figure out the second one. Trying to remove each and every item it
looked like a not-so-smart move, but turned out to be an accepted solution. I
am not sure at this point if there's a better way to achieve the result, but at
least I got my second gold star! Bonus: I still managed to use Rust :) Go on!

# Day 1
Here we go again! This year will be different for me. A lot in my real life is
happening, and I hope I will find the time to participate at least a bit in AoC.
One thing I would like to try is Rust language even though I am not sure how
far I can get with this. Let's see!
