# Lesson Learned
This file is a reminder for myself to understand what I did not know
when solving the AoC challenges, and how can I improve myself next
time I will face a similar problem. As well as some noticeable facts that
happened during the AoC.

# Day 1
Here we go again! This year will be different for me. A lot in my real life is
happening, and I hope I will find the time to participate at least a bit in AoC.
One thing I would like to try is Rust language even though I am not sure how
far I can get with this. Let's see!
